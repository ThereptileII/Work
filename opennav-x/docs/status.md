# OpenNav X status — 2026-09-25

**Beta 1 software qualified: all ten CI jobs passed, downloaded release verified, native visual review complete.**

Beta 1 (`0.3.0-beta1`) is the software package for desktop and staged boat
commissioning. It is not approved for navigation or production use. Physical
boat acceptance is separate. No autonomous steering is implemented.

Qualified application/source commit: `a3e6e0812e01d2aee8f0b83807527b9a0c0fc79a`.
[CI run 36137990012](https://github.com/ThereptileII/Work/actions/runs/36137990012).
[Acceptance and download verification](evidence/beta1-a3e6e08-accepted.json).

OpenCPN remains pinned to **5.12.4 /
`37fd0cddb7334fe489e9f18aa163977a9c5c84f7`**. Windows retains the supported
**x86 application/plugin ABI on Windows x64**. The `win64` suffix describes the
host. The pristine upstream checkout is unchanged; the reviewed integration
patch is documented in [upstream patches](upstream-patches.md).

## Download and first test

[Download OpenNavX-Beta1-Windows](https://github.com/ThereptileII/Work/actions/runs/36137990012/artifacts/10876531379).
Extract that outer Actions archive to find:

- `OpenNavX-Beta1-Portable-win64.zip`
- `OpenNavX-Beta1-Setup.exe`
- `OpenNavX-Beta1-Test-Guide.md`
- `OpenNavX-Beta1-Boat-Commissioning.md`
- `OpenNavX-Beta1-source.zip`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`

Extract the complete portable ZIP to a short writable folder, then run
`Run-XNav-Demo.cmd`. Confirm DEMO and real coastline/chart content. Portable
modes use an isolated profile. Before Setup, back up the normal OpenCPN profile
and follow the [desktop guide](beta/OpenNavX-Beta1-Test-Guide.md). Setup uses
the normal shared profile and runs beside the untouched original executable.
Choose Update for an existing Alpha installation. Alpha's historical install
directory/Start-menu folder remain to preserve upgrade continuity.

## Exact-revision qualification

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Portable contracts | 60 suites on each platform; ten additional restart repetitions separately |
| Linux integrated | 106 cases; live input, route, object/AIS/anchor, recording, pilot, recovery, UI and chart gates |
| Native Windows MSVC | 98 cases; same functional boundaries, extracted portable launch and three recovery cycles |
| Installer | 29 real lifecycle checks, including accepted Alpha upgrade and failure recovery; 39 filesystem checks in each 32/64-bit PowerShell 5.1 host |
| Display | Real 1280×800 at 96/120/144 DPI; mouse, injected touch tap/pan, fullscreen, Night and mode returns |
| Charts/plugins | Public NOAA ENC plus deterministic coastline checks; Dashboard, GRIB and WMM; Windows software fallback, Linux software/llvmpipe OpenGL |
| Endurance | Three actual hours each; Linux 10,800.175 s / Windows 10,800.109 s; 1,080 samples and 540 page actions each |
| Download/review | Five release hashes, 1,009 portable file hashes and 4,814 source ZIP entries verified; 40 native Windows and three Linux images individually reviewed |

Repeated tests are not counted as additional distinct cases. Native Windows
images are authoritative; injected touch does not establish physical touchscreen
acceptance. Hosted Windows rejected hardware OpenGL, so target GPU testing
remains open. Exact measurements and screenshot hashes are in the evidence. Sustained resident
growth was 184 KiB on Linux and 2.97 MiB on Windows; Windows private growth was
3.73 MiB. Linux descriptors/threads and Windows handles/GDI/USER had zero median
growth. Mean CPU was 1.65% / 1.10% of one core respectively. Maximum page
observation was 1.25 s / 1.73 s, including the 1 Hz diagnostic observation delay;
these are not paint-latency measurements or a universal leak-free claim.

## Implemented Beta product

| Area | Implementation and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Navigation/shell | Real chart; touch controls, follow/orientation/measure, contextual pages, configurable rail, Day/Dusk/Night, fullscreen, persistent alerts and Legacy/Safe restart. |
| Routes/waypoints | OpenCPN-owned storage/progress, guarded basic creation/edit/activation/reversal, next point and remaining-distance snapshot. Advanced/protected cases remain in Legacy. |
| Marine data | Selected OpenCPN navigation plus NMEA 0183, 15 supported N2K PGNs and own-vessel Signal K; physical NAME, source precedence/age/cadence and explicit invalid/unavailable/uncertain state. |
| Propulsion/battery | Standard marine acquisition plus explicitly bound boat adapter; independent producer-expiry contract; high-voltage 127751, SOC 127506, gear/regen and motor-temperature meaning where configured. No PC Leaf CAN decoder. |
| Energy | Explicit capacity/reserve/sign/auxiliary assumptions, empirical curve import, filtered speed/power calibration export, advisory route energy/range/arrival SOC with quality and blocking reasons. |
| Commissioning | Per-item health/PGN/instance diagnostics, bounded opt-in recording, deterministic REPLAY with historical ages and controls disabled, privacy-limited field diagnostic ZIP. |
| SmartNav/AIS | Turn/timeline/energy advice, OpenCPN CPA/TCPA/alarm context, modern target selection/card/detail and expiring chart highlight. No autonomous command path. |
| Anchor/alerts | Normal OpenCPN anchor watch, distance/history/depth/wind/battery and a persistent actionable alert layer. No invented drag prediction or automatic standby. |
| Manual pilot | ST4000 adapter, exact identity binding, bidirectional TCP Actisense transport, six manual commands, feedback/timeout/rate limits and every-start OFF. Simulator retained; TRACK/WIND unavailable. |
| Hazards/radar | Tested bounded corridor/provider architecture and unavailable/uncertain semantics. No accepted live ENC corridor provider or Pathfinder display/control adapter. |
| Robustness | External JSON/input bounds, malformed/stale/reconnect tests, two-failure startup Safe fallback, serial-discovery resource ownership and installation failure recovery. |
| Distribution | Hash-gated side-by-side per-user Setup; real Alpha update, immutable generations, repair/rollback/uninstall; stock executable/shared profile preserved; isolated portable recovery. |

Contracts: [marine input](marine-input-contract.md), [boat producer](boat-propulsion-contract.md),
[recording/calibration](recording-replay-contract.md), [energy](energy-model.md),
[pilot](st4000-beta-contract.md), [AIS](ais-beta-contract.md),
[alerts](operational-alerts.md), [display](display-beta-contract.md),
[robustness](beta-robustness.md), [installer](installer-transaction-contract.md).

## Stable foundation and feedback

The reported Legacy → XNav blank-chart regression remains closed by `16dbaf7`
and repeated exact-release coastline/ENC/mode-return checks. The active-leg
console overlap was closed in accepted Alpha `08bc92f`. The user's Alpha
acceptance and deliberate deferrals are recorded in [the Beta plan](beta1-plan.md).
The immutable remaining-route contract retains normal upstream active-point
range plus subsequent stored legs; no independent navigation calculation.

Earlier accepted increments and rejected candidates remain in
[development history](status-history-beta-development.md) and [evidence](evidence/).
Failed runs are not release acceptance.

## Post-build visual review and deliberate deferrals

- Diagnostics retains an old **ALPHA 1 / NOT FOR NAVIGATION** warning caption.
  The separate Beta 1 version, commit and compiler fields are correct. This is
  a cosmetic label issue, recorded for the next feedback-driven increment.
- At 150% the transient System popup partly covers the Alerts button. Critical
  alert text remains visible; press Escape or click outside to dismiss the
  popup before opening Alerts. This presentation refinement is deferred.
- With larger DPI or an alert, use Up/Down or pan to reach lower rail/page
  values. The heading card can be partly outside the viewport even at 100%
  with an alert; configure the rail order to prioritize desired instruments.

These acceptance notes follow the build; they do not change the downloaded
binaries or their bundled guides. Of the 78 automated DPI captures, a subset
is included in the 40 individually reviewed Windows images. Fullscreen was
1920×1080; normal window gates were 1280×800.

## Remaining physical/product gates

Follow [boat commissioning](boat-commissioning.md): read-only first, propulsion
comparisons/calibration next, pilot status next, then individual deliberate
commands in a secured safe environment, and supervised underway trials last.
The C6 producer patch compiled but was not flashed. The complete PC → gateway
→ ESP32 → SeaTalk → ST4000 path still needs physical feedback/loss validation.
Physical touch, target GPU/navigation PC, broader plugins, radar hardware, live
ENC corridor integration and at-sea operation remain open. Beta is unsigned;
native/Legacy dialogs can remain bright. [Known limitations](beta/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

Stop at Beta 1 for user/boat feedback. No production-release work or autonomous
steering is authorized by this acceptance.
