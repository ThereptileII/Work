# OpenNav X status — 2026-09-26

**Beta 2 development is in progress; it is not yet qualified or deployed.**

The user's Desktop feedback has been read completely and recorded in
[boat Beta 1 feedback](feedback/boat-beta1-feedback.md). The approved design
reference is the Beta 2 baseline. Current work separates fixture-enabled CI
executables from the installed product, refines shared visual components and
navigation workflows, and adds repeatable boat deployment and maintenance tools.
The accepted Beta 1 results below remain historical evidence, not Beta 2 gates.

### Boat prerequisite — official 5.12.4 upgrade verified

Read-only inspection found **OpenCPN 5.12.2-0+b69f44c / x86**, executable SHA-256
`2fdcd6a2cdef7f730aa4c094fcd21302ed2a5d531a611ee180c06533f3a2cb48`.
The user authorized a backed-up upgrade. The official visible Upgrade has now
completed, and the installed **5.12.4 x86** executable matches the validated hash
`7c6547562cca7954671eaab72833ca9d788710fd9808b6a699b6dc823852ae0c`.
All 539 profile files remained byte-identical. Complete third-party plugin files,
the RTL-SDR registration and its original uninstaller were preserved; no recovery
copy-back was needed. The original cold backup remains verified and retained.
The wizard's Upgrade/reset/summary/Finish screenshots were reviewed; Run and
Show were unchecked, and OpenCPN was not launched. Tailscale, SSH and RustDesk
remain running. [Upgrade evidence](evidence/beta2-boat-stock-5.12.4-upgrade.json).
This closes the stock-version prerequisite; Beta 2 still requires its own gates.

The actual shared profile's `opencpn.ini` was already zero-filled at first
inspection (21,380 bytes; last written 2026-09-20). A same-sized nonzero temporary
INI from the same write interval is preserved as a potential recovery source.
Neither file has been restored or replaced. A cold, hash-verified recovery set is complete: 2,123 application files and
539 profile files (1,318,897,252 bytes). The earlier incomplete attempt remains
separate and is not an accepted backup.
Private chart/profile content remains on the boat PC or in ignored local
inspection evidence, never in the repository.

The normal profile includes an output-capable NMEA 2000 connection and enabled
pilot plugins. No real-profile launch or physical command has been attempted.
A read-only commissioning policy must address third-party plugin outputs as
well as OpenNav's own control switch. Saved user diagnostics show prior live
GPS, heading, wind and depth; this is not current-session hardware acceptance.
Reported desktop mode is 1920×1080 and the saved application DPI is 144;
1280×800 physical-display acceptance remains outstanding.

The old Developer Preview portable folder has been retired by an atomic move
into the boat-local recovery archive, with ownership hash checked before and
after and a durable recovery journal. No profile/chart/user file was deleted.
Beta 1 remains available until a known-good replacement can be installed. Six
obsolete download ZIPs (five identical accepted Beta 1 archives and one accepted
Developer Preview archive, 912,982,707 bytes) have also been moved into versioned
boat-local recovery storage. Every ZIP matched its accepted release SHA-256
before and after the atomic move; durable records retain the original location.
No unrelated Desktop content is included in feedback documentation.

### Beta 2 implementation and validation under way

- Production defaults to `XNAV_ENABLE_TEST_FIXTURES=OFF`; deterministic sources
  remain in separate test code. Package/installer self-tests must reject a
  fixture-enabled executable.
- Alerts share the fixed top status area; the primary rail has four visible
  values without a narrow scrolling viewport. Center and the current palette
  have explicit labels. System uses a page rather than a tall popup.
- Route/energy, instruments, settings and manual pilot layouts are being
  refined against the reference. Native and boat visual review are pending.
- Integration fixes cover chart-layout restoration after actual settings
  reconfiguration, whole-metre anchor labels, safe cleanup of XNav-owned anchor
  marks and copied chart context/Go To actions.
- Late-created input-only loopback GPS and actual AIS decoding pass 17 grouped
  Linux object/integration checks, including copied waypoint context and compact
  chart cards. Earlier UTC+2 testing exposed and fixed AIS observation
  clock conversion that made fresh targets appear two hours stale. Four added
  integrated clock tests pass in UTC and UTC+2. Boat reception remains pending.
- Portable contract suite: 63 passing cases/suites in local development.
  Integrated fixture-enabled Linux build passes. The separate fixture-free
  Linux product passes 110/110 integrated regressions and five loader/resource
  self-test checks. These are local development results, not exact-release
  qualification. Seven actual-pointer workflow groups also pass: orientation,
  context dismissal, waypoint create/Go To/stop, route point entry/Undo,
  cancellation and named save with a read-only database preservation audit.
  Native and boat execution of these expanded workflows remains pending.
- Beta 2 installer wizard, versioned maintenance and boat scripts are implemented
  but their new native lifecycle gates have not yet run.
- First CI candidate `15e5a265` exposed a Windows-only line-ending assumption in
  a source-archive test. The corrected candidate `a0af22c248f8a81bb8068ccf3f64bd921478060f`
  is running in [CI 36266809347](https://github.com/ThereptileII/Work/actions/runs/36266809347).
  Linux and Windows contract jobs pass. Native MSVC integration builds and all
  102 integrated CTest cases pass, followed by mode/persistence checks. Its
  navigation UI smoke stopped at an old source-caption assertion after alerts
  moved into that header slot; the replacement asserts the critical-position
  alert and retained stale ages explicitly. Six native frame/mode screenshots
  were reviewed in [the first native review](design/reviews/beta2-native-a0af22c.md).
  Complete Windows, packaging and boat gates remain pending. No Beta 2 release
  acceptance is implied.
- Follow-up source `ee720380ac72b7459f5ff0538acecb9c2b650180`
  ([CI 36269508823](https://github.com/ThereptileII/Work/actions/runs/36269508823))
  matches all 493 local tracked source blobs and file modes. Its Windows boat-tool
  fixture exposed .NET Framework ZIP backslash entries; the fixture now emits
  the same slash paths as real Python packaging while rejection of unsafe ZIP
  paths remains tested. The correction passes 21 isolated native Windows checks.
  Linux build/CTest and navigation, recording, route, marine, Signal K and pilot
  transport gates pass, but the object workflow stopped at compact waypoint
  Details. This candidate is not qualified; the interaction failure is under
  investigation before the next full run.
- The authorized official-stock upgrade uses a separate reviewed visible-wizard
  driver, not the OpenNav installer or silent replacement. Native PS5.1 passes
  86 policy/helper checks, 21 filesystem groups and 23 profile-preparation groups.
  The bare OpenCPN registration is explicitly identified as the inspected RTL-SDR
  plugin, with complete value/type and uninstaller preservation. Temporary-file
  recovery tests confirmed Windows adds the DACL AutoInherited metadata bit;
  ownership, protection and every ordered ACE must remain exact. The independent
  real-profile repair remains separate from the completed stock upgrade.
- Candidate `06f3bc32879cff4b1822ff53710388b1146d05a7`
  ([CI 36271371549](https://github.com/ThereptileII/Work/actions/runs/36271371549))
  includes the corrected ZIP fixture, X11 pointer-target observations and native
  boat maintenance tests. All 506 local tracked source blobs/modes match the
  published tree. The object harness passed two additional local 17-group runs;
  full candidate qualification is pending.

## Accepted Beta 1 baseline

**Beta 1 software qualified: all ten CI jobs passed, downloaded release verified, native visual review complete.**

Beta 1 (`0.3.0-beta1`) is the software package for desktop and staged boat
commissioning. It is not approved for navigation or production use. Physical
boat acceptance is separate. No autonomous steering is implemented.

Qualified application/source commit: `a3e6e0812e01d2aee8f0b83807527b9a0c0fc79a`.
[CI run 36137990012](https://github.com/ThereptileII/Work/actions/runs/36137990012).
[Acceptance and download verification](evidence/beta1-a3e6e08-accepted.json).

OpenCPN remains pinned to **5.12.4 /
`37fd0cddb7334fe489e9f18aa163977a9c5c84f7`**. Windows retains the supported
**x86 application/plugin ABI on Windows x64**. The `win64` suffix describes the
host. The pristine upstream checkout is unchanged; the reviewed integration
patch is documented in [upstream patches](upstream-patches.md).

## Download and first test

[Download OpenNavX-Beta1-Windows](https://github.com/ThereptileII/Work/actions/runs/36137990012/artifacts/10876531379).
Extract that outer Actions archive to find:

- `OpenNavX-Beta1-Portable-win64.zip`
- `OpenNavX-Beta1-Setup.exe`
- `OpenNavX-Beta1-Test-Guide.md`
- `OpenNavX-Beta1-Boat-Commissioning.md`
- `OpenNavX-Beta1-source.zip`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`

Extract the complete portable ZIP to a short writable folder, then run
`Run-XNav-Demo.cmd`. Confirm DEMO and real coastline/chart content. Portable
modes use an isolated profile. Before Setup, back up the normal OpenCPN profile
and follow the [desktop guide](beta/OpenNavX-Beta1-Test-Guide.md). Setup uses
the normal shared profile and runs beside the untouched original executable.
Choose Update for an existing Alpha installation. Alpha's historical install
directory/Start-menu folder remain to preserve upgrade continuity.

## Exact-revision qualification

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Portable contracts | 60 suites on each platform; ten additional restart repetitions separately |
| Linux integrated | 106 cases; live input, route, object/AIS/anchor, recording, pilot, recovery, UI and chart gates |
| Native Windows MSVC | 98 cases; same functional boundaries, extracted portable launch and three recovery cycles |
| Installer | 29 real lifecycle checks, including accepted Alpha upgrade and failure recovery; 39 filesystem checks in each 32/64-bit PowerShell 5.1 host |
| Display | Real 1280×800 at 96/120/144 DPI; mouse, injected touch tap/pan, fullscreen, Night and mode returns |
| Charts/plugins | Public NOAA ENC plus deterministic coastline checks; Dashboard, GRIB and WMM; Windows software fallback, Linux software/llvmpipe OpenGL |
| Endurance | Three actual hours each; Linux 10,800.175 s / Windows 10,800.109 s; 1,080 samples and 540 page actions each |
| Download/review | Five release hashes, 1,009 portable file hashes and 4,814 source ZIP entries verified; 40 native Windows and three Linux images individually reviewed |

Repeated tests are not counted as additional distinct cases. Native Windows
images are authoritative; injected touch does not establish physical touchscreen
acceptance. Hosted Windows rejected hardware OpenGL, so target GPU testing
remains open. Exact measurements and screenshot hashes are in the evidence. Sustained resident
growth was 184 KiB on Linux and 2.97 MiB on Windows; Windows private growth was
3.73 MiB. Linux descriptors/threads and Windows handles/GDI/USER had zero median
growth. Mean CPU was 1.65% / 1.10% of one core respectively. Maximum page
observation was 1.25 s / 1.73 s, including the 1 Hz diagnostic observation delay;
these are not paint-latency measurements or a universal leak-free claim.

## Implemented Beta product

## Stable foundation and feedback

The reported Legacy → XNav blank-chart regression remains closed by `16dbaf7`
and repeated exact-release coastline/ENC/mode-return checks. The active-leg
console overlap was closed in accepted Alpha `08bc92f`. The user's Alpha
acceptance and deliberate deferrals are recorded in [the Beta plan](beta1-plan.md).
The immutable remaining-route contract retains normal upstream active-point
range plus subsequent stored legs; no independent navigation calculation.

Earlier accepted increments and rejected candidates remain in
[development history](status-history-beta-development.md) and [evidence](evidence/).
Failed runs are not release acceptance.

## Post-build visual review and deliberate deferrals

- Diagnostics retains an old **ALPHA 1 / NOT FOR NAVIGATION** warning caption.
  The separate Beta 1 version, commit and compiler fields are correct. This is
  a cosmetic label issue, recorded for the next feedback-driven increment.
- At 150% the transient System popup partly covers the Alerts button. Critical
  alert text remains visible; press Escape or click outside to dismiss the
  popup before opening Alerts. This presentation refinement is deferred.
- With larger DPI or an alert, use Up/Down or pan to reach lower rail/page
  values. The heading card can be partly outside the viewport even at 100%
  with an alert; configure the rail order to prioritize desired instruments.

These acceptance notes follow the build; they do not change the downloaded
binaries or their bundled guides. Of the 78 automated DPI captures, a subset
is included in the 40 individually reviewed Windows images. Fullscreen was
1920×1080; normal window gates were 1280×800.

## Remaining physical/product gates

Follow [boat commissioning](boat-commissioning.md): read-only first, propulsion
comparisons/calibration next, pilot status next, then individual deliberate
commands in a secured safe environment, and supervised underway trials last.
The C6 producer patch compiled but was not flashed. The complete PC → gateway
→ ESP32 → SeaTalk → ST4000 path still needs physical feedback/loss validation.
Physical touch, target GPU/navigation PC, broader plugins, radar hardware, live
ENC corridor integration and at-sea operation remain open. Beta is unsigned;
native/Legacy dialogs can remain bright. [Known limitations](beta/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

Stop at Beta 1 for user/boat feedback. No production-release work or autonomous
steering is authorized by this acceptance.
